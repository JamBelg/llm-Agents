The tournament, won by Australian Ken Rosewall, was the first Grand Slam tournament to be played in the Open era.[18]\\nSwede BjÃ¶rn Borg won the majority of the tournaments in the early years of the Open era. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[13]\\nBetween 1924 and 1932 the title was won by a member of The Four Musketeers.
